DineWithMeCore
==============

The core (model) logic of the DineWithMe application.

As of 3/12/2014:
----------------
- Main Menu
- Login functionality
- Create user functionality
- Correct handling of active sessions
- Correct encryption and database communcation
- Refactored the old database schema
- Refactored the old database connection handling
- Improved modularity in net.itca.core.data
- Facade directs calls to correct sub-database class
- Exception tunneling to controllers (instead of handling them in the facade)
- Removed DataSource interface - chose for inheritance for easier connection management
- Correct logout behaviour (Session no longer stores userID)
- Friend system completed:
	- Friend requests (sending, accepting, declining)
	- View friends
	- View invites
- Refactored database to deal with friend system functions
- Extending the facade to deal with new database system
